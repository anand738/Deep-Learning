# Tutorial 36 - Backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks

## 1. What Is Backpropagation in RNNs?
Backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) refers to the process of computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters and updating them to minimize the loss, accounting for the temporal dependencies in sequential data. Known as **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**, it extends standard backpropagation (used in feedforward networks) to handle the recurrent connections of RNNs, which process sequences across time steps.

- **Process**: BPTT unrolls the RNN across time steps, computes gradients for each step, and propagates errors backward to update weights.
- **Purpose**: Trains RNNs to learn temporal patterns for tasks like sequence classification, time-series forecasting, or video analysis.
- **Key Feature**: Accounts for the shared weights across time steps, making it distinct from CNN backpropagation.

**Visual Description**: 
- A diagram showing an unrolled RNN with a sequence (e.g., $[x_1, x_2, x_3]$), forward propagation producing outputs ($y_1, y_2, y_3$), and backward propagation computing gradients through time steps to update weights.

## 2. Mechanics of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
BPTT unrolls the RNN into a computational graph across time steps, treating it as a deep feedforward network with shared weights, and applies backpropagation to compute gradients.

1. **Forward Propagation** (Tutorial 33):
   - For a sequence $[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_T]$, compute hidden states $h_t$ and outputs $y_t$ at each time step $t$:
     $ h_t = \tanh(W_{xh}x_t + W_{hh}h_{t-1} + b_h) $
     $ y_t = W_{hy}h_t + b_y $
   - Compute the loss $L$ (e.g., binary cross-entropy) over all time steps or at the final step.

2. **Loss Function**: Typically summed or averaged over time steps:
   $ L = \sum_{t=1}^T L_t(y_t, \hat{y}_t) $ (for sequence outputs) or $ L = L_T(y_T, \hat{y}_T) $ (for final output).

3. **Backward Propagation**:
   - Compute gradients of the loss with respect to outputs: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t}$.
   - Backpropagate through the output layer: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t} W_{hy}$.
   - Backpropagate through time steps, from $t=T$ to $t=1$:
     - For each time step $t$, compute:
       $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_{t+1}} W_{hh} \cdot \tanh'(\cdot) + \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t} W_{hy} $
     - Accumulate gradients for shared weights:
       $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{xh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} x_t $
       $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{hh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} h_{t-1} $
       $ \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{hy}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t} h_t $
   - Update weights using an optimizer (e.g., Adam): $ W \gets W - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W} $.

4. **Key Parameters**:
   - **Input Size**: Dimension of $x_t$ (e.g., 32 for embeddings).
   - **Hidden Size**: Dimension of $h_t$ (e.g., 64 units).
   - **Learning Rate ($\eta$)**: Controls weight updates (e.g., 0.01).
   - **Sequence Length ($T$)**: Number of time steps (e.g., 10).

**Challenges**:
- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**: Gradients can shrink or grow exponentially over long sequences (mitigated by LSTM/GRU).
- **Computational Cost**: BPTT is resource-intensive for long sequences due to unrolling.

**Visual Description**: 
- An unrolled RNN diagram showing forward propagation (inputs to outputs) and backward propagation (gradients flowing backward through time steps), with gradients accumulating for shared weights.

## 3. Why BPTT Matters
- **Temporal Learning**: BPTT enables RNNs to learn dependencies across time steps (e.g., word relationships in a sentence or object tracking in video frames).
- **Weight Sharing**: Shared weights ($W_{xh}$, $W_{hh}$, $W_{hy}$) across time steps reduce parameters but require careful gradient computation.
- **Contrast with CNNs**: Unlike CNN backpropagation (e.g., YOLO in Tutorial 30), which processes spatial data in one pass, BPTT handles temporal data iteratively, making it suitable for sequential tasks.

**Visual Description**: 
- A comparison of CNN backpropagation (single-pass gradient flow for an image) vs. RNN BPTT (gradient flow through time steps for a sequence), highlighting the temporal aspect.

## 4. Code Example
Below is a TensorFlow code example demonstrating BPTT for a sequence classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis on a dummy dataset). The code manually implements forward and backward propagation to illustrate BPTT mechanics.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy dataset: 5 sequences, each of length 10, with 32-dimensional inputs
X = np.random.randn(5, 10, 32).astype(np.float32)  # [batch, time_steps, input_size]
y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1], dtype=np.float32)  # Binary labels

# RNN parameters
input_size = 32
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 1

# Initialize weights and biases
W_xh = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([input_size, hidden_size], stddev=0.01))
W_hh = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([hidden_size, hidden_size], stddev=0.01))
W_hy = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([hidden_size, output_size], stddev=0.01))
b_h = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([hidden_size]))
b_y = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([output_size]))

# Manual RNN forward and backward propagation
def rnn_bptt(X, y, W_xh, W_hh, W_hy, b_h, b_y):
    batch_size, time_steps, _ = X.shape
    h_t = tf.zeros([batch_size, hidden_size])  # Initial hidden state
    hidden_states = [h_t]
    outputs = []

    # Forward propagation
    for t in range(time_steps):
        x_t = X[:, t, :]  # Input at time t
        h_t = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(x_t, W_xh) + tf.matmul(h_t, W_hh) + b_h)  # Hidden state
        hidden_states.append(h_t)
        y_t = tf.matmul(h_t, W_hy) + b_y  # Output
        outputs.append(y_t)

    outputs = tf.stack(outputs, axis=1)  # [batch, time_steps, output_size]
    final_output = outputs[:, -1, :]  # Use last time step for classification
    predictions = tf.sigmoid(final_output)

    # Compute loss
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y, tf.squeeze(predictions)))

    return loss, predictions, hidden_states

# Training loop with BPTT
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
for epoch in range(5):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss, predictions, _ = rnn_bptt(X, y, W_xh, W_hh, W_hy, b_h, b_y)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, [W_xh, W_hh, W_hy, b_h, b_y])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [W_xh, W_hh, W_hy, b_h, b_y]))
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy():.4f}")

# Inference
_, predictions, _ = rnn_bptt(X, y, W_xh, W_hh, W_hy, b_h, b_y)
for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
    print(f"Sequence {i+1} predicted sentiment: {'Positive' if pred.numpy()[0] > 0.5 else 'Negative'} (Probability: {pred.numpy()[0]:.2f})")
```

**Output** (example, varies due to random data):
```
Epoch 1, Loss: 0.6932
Epoch 2, Loss: 0.6801
...
Epoch 5, Loss: 0.6105
Sequence 1 predicted sentiment: Positive (Probability: 0.62)
Sequence 2 predicted sentiment: Negative (Probability: 0.38)
...
```

**Explanation**:
- **Model**: A manual RNN implementation with a single layer, processing sequences of 10 time steps with 32-dimensional inputs.
- **Input**: Dummy sequences (5 samples, 10 time steps, 32 features) and binary labels (e.g., sentiment).
- **Forward Propagation**: Computes hidden states and outputs iteratively, as in Tutorial 33.
- **BPTT**: Uses TensorFlow’s `GradientTape` to compute gradients through time, updating weights ($W_{xh}$, $W_{hh}$, $W_{hy}$, $b_h$, $b_y$) to minimize binary cross-entropy loss.
- **Output**: Predicted sentiment (positive/negative) for each sequence based on the final time step.

**Visual Description**: 
- A diagram showing an unrolled RNN with forward propagation (inputs to outputs) and BPTT (gradients flowing backward from the loss through time steps), highlighting gradient accumulation for shared weights.
