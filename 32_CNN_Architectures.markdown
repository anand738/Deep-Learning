# Tutorial 32 - Different Types of CNN Architectures

## 1. What Are CNN Architectures?
CNN architectures are specialized neural network designs tailored for processing grid-like data, such as images, using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Each architecture has unique characteristics, making it suitable for specific tasks like image classification, object detection, or segmentation.

- **Purpose**: Extract features (e.g., edges, textures, objects) efficiently and perform tasks like classification or detection.
- **Key Components**: Convolution, pooling, and dense layers, combined in different ways.
- **Focus**: This tutorial explores major CNN architectures, their structures, and their applications.

**Visual Description**:

## 4. Code Example
Below is a TensorFlow code example demonstrating the use of a pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification, adaptable for feature extraction in tasks like object detection. VGG16 is chosen for its simplicity and widespread use in transfer learning.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Load pre-trained VGG16 model (pre-trained on ImageNet)
model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=True, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Load and preprocess a test image
image_path = 'test_image.jpg'  # Replace with your image
try:
    image = load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
except:
    # Fallback: Dummy image (224x224x3)
    image = np.random.randint(0, 255, (224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.array_to_img(image)

# Convert image to array and preprocess
image_array = img_to_array(image)
image_array = np.expand_dims(image_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
image_array = tf.keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input(image_array)

# Predict class
predictions = model.predict(image_array)
decoded_predictions = tf.keras.applications.vgg16.decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]

# Print top predictions
for _, class_name, prob in decoded_predictions:
    print(f"Predicted: {class_name} (Confidence: {prob:.2f})")

# Visualize feature maps (optional, from first conv layer)
feature_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.layers[1].output)
feature_maps = feature_model.predict(image_array)
feature_map = feature_maps[0, :, :, 0]  # First feature map
feature_map = cv2.resize(feature_map, (224, 224))  # Resize for visualization
cv2.imwrite('feature_map_vgg16.jpg', feature_map * 255)  # Save feature map
```

**Output** (example, varies due to image):
```
Predicted: tabby (Confidence: 0.85)
Predicted: tiger_cat (Confidence: 0.10)
Predicted: Egyptian_cat (Confidence: 0.05)
```

**Explanation**:
- **Model**: Pre-trained VGG16, loaded with ImageNet weights for classification.
- **Input**: A 224x224x3 RGB image (real or dummy).
- **Output**: Top predicted classes with confidence scores (e.g., for a cat image).
- **Feature Maps**: Extracts the output of the first convolutional layer to visualize learned features (e.g., edges).
- **For Object Detection**: VGG16 can be used as a backbone in Faster R-CNN (Tutorial 27) for custom object detection by replacing the fully connected layers with an RPN and RoI pooling.
